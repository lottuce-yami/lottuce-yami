### Good morning ☀️

I'm [Lotte 🥬](https://t.me/lottuce_yami "Telegram"), a newbie that *wishes* to create entertaining things for myself and friends.  
I administer a non-popular private Minecraft server **Raramur** ![logo](https://api.mcsrvstat.us/icon/raramur.ru:25565) and try to write plugins (or else) for it.

`Minecraft nickname: Consolka`
